their web pages using style sheets. Students learn basic concepts of computer programming to code visual scenes that
include animation and user interaction leading to a final project where students program their own game. No
programming or computer science experience is needed. This course meets the Business graduation requirement."

to introduce students to a broad range of computer science topics. Students explore the impact of computer science on
society by studying the internet, image encoding, compression, JavaScript programming, data analytics, Big Data and
cybersecurity. Students have a chance to express their creativity while demonstrating their understanding of computer
science concepts. Students who have a computer science background should take this course if they want to broaden their
CS experience. Students who do not have a computer science background should take this course to get an understanding
of CS topics that can be helpful in many careers such as business, engineering, science and the arts. Students will submit
one project to College Board and prepare to take the “AP Computer Science Principles” test in May. No computer science
experience is needed. Students must have strong Algebra skills and strong written communication skills. This course
meets the Business graduation requirement and counts as a science elective. AP Exam registration will take place in
September and October. Standard AP fees apply."

JavaScript and web design, utilizing HTML and CSS to build programming skills and apply them in a web environment. In
the second semester, students will learn Python and programming concepts that are applicable to any programming
language. Students will also be introduced to the basic concepts of databases including types of databases, database
design, tables, queries, reports, and applications. Students will also be introduced to BIG Data and data mining. Students
will also develop business application using database software such as Microsoft Access. Requirement: AP Computer

        improving his strength, explosive power, speed, and agility through a strenuous training program involving weight
        training, plyometric, speed development, and agility drills. Students will be evaluated on participation, proper dress,
        workout log upkeep, quizzes, and improvement over the course of the semester in strength (as measured by a 1-rep max
        of the bench press, squat, and power clean) and explosive power and speed (as measured by 40-yard dash time, 20-yard
        Pro-agility test, 20-yard acceleration test, and vertical jump). Requirement: Complete the two graduation-required
        physical education credits through required PE courses and/or an alternate credit option. A maximum of 8 total credits
        can be earned in elective physical education courses. It is recommended that FHS athletes complete the prerequisite
        physical education credits by the end of their freshman year so they can enter APC as a sophomore."
