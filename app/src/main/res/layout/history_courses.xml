introductory college or university world history course. According to the College Board, AP World History Modern
students â€œinvestigate significant events, individuals, developments, and processes in historical periods from
approximately 1200 CE to the present. Students develop and use the same skills, practices, and methods employed by
historians: analyzing primary and secondary sources; making historical comparisons; utilizing reasoning about
contextualization, causation, and continuity and change over time; and developing historical arguments. The course
provides five themes that students explore throughout the course in order to make connections among historical
developments in different times and places: interactions between humans and the environment; development and
interaction of cultures; state building, expansion, and conflict; creation, expansion, and interaction of economic systems;
and development and transformation of social structures. Summer reading information will be distributed in the spring.
Recommendation: 3.4 GPA. Exam registration will take place in September and October. Standard AP fees apply."
