course provides students with additional time to build the foundations necessary for high school math courses, while

with the critical areas of Algebra I: Relationships between quantities and reasoning with equations; linear and
exponential relationships; descriptive statistics; expressions and equations; and quadratic functions and modeling.
Algebra Enrichment is a lab course which allows for additional time and resources for students to continue to build on
course work from Algebra I. This course counts as a math course for the General Diploma only and as an elective for
the Core 40, Core 40 with Honors, or Core 40 with Technical Honors Diplomas."

should extend to include polynomial, rational, radical, logarithmic, and other functions. Students should be able to model
real-world problems with various functions using and translating between multiple representations. Additionally,
students should be able to interpret key features of function models within a given context. Requirement: Successful
completion of Algebra I. This course fulfills the Algebra II requirement for all diplomas; if students use this course to

        training, plyometric, speed development, and agility drills. Students will be evaluated on participation, proper dress,
        workout log upkeep, quizzes, and improvement over the course of the semester in strength (as measured by a 1-rep max
        of the bench press, squat, and power clean) and explosive power and speed (as measured by 40-yard dash time, 20-yard
        Pro-agility test, 20-yard acceleration test, and vertical jump). Requirement: Complete the two graduation-required
        physical education credits through required PE courses and/or an alternate credit option. A maximum of 8 total credits
        can be earned in elective physical education courses. It is recommended that FHS athletes complete the prerequisite
